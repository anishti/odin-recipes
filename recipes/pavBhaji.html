    <h1>Pav Bhaji</h1>
    <img src="../images/pavBhaji.jpg" alt="photo of pav Bhaji" width="200">
    <p>I made this after trying different methods over a few years. It all came together so well.<br> 
        The flavor and texture was amazing. You really need to add water at the end and not be<br> 
        scared that it will ruin the dish, it will not! You need a fairly runny consistency for<br>
         the best pav bhaji. Garnish with fresh chopped tomatoes, onions, and fresh cilantro if<br>
         desired. Serve with toasted white bread or bread rolls.
