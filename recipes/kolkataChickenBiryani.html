    <p>Chicken biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's typically reserved<br> 
        for special occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such as Ramadan.<br> 
        It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth it.<br> 
        For biryani, basmati rice is the ideal variety to use.</p>
