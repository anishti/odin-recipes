    <p>Chicken biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's typically reserved<br> 
        for special occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such as Ramadan.<br> 
        It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth it.<br> 
        For biryani, basmati rice is the ideal variety to use.</p>


        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <li><strong>Basmati Rice:</strong>Long-grain basmati rice is traditionally used to make biryani.<br> I prefer the Kohinoor brand extra-long grain basmati rice, which is easily available at Indian grocery stores.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Chicken:</strong>Traditionally, whole bone-in chicken pieces are used to make biryani.<br> Here in the US, it can be tough to find a whole chicken that's properly cut for biryani.<br> As a handy shortcut, I like to use a mix of bone-in drumsticks and boneless chicken thighs.<br> This way, you still get those authentic flavors and tender, juicy meat!</li>
    <li><strong>Whole Spices:</strong>shahi jeera, bay leaves, star anise, cloves, and green cardamom pods.<br> A classic combination of spices to infuse the rice with rich flavor.<br> Read more about each of these spices in my Essential Indian Spice Guide.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Ground Spices:</strong>turmeric, Kashmiri red chili powder, Biryani Masala.<br> Garam masala can be used in a pinch in place of Biryani Masala.</li>
    <li><strong>Yellow Onion:</strong>hinly sliced yellow onion caramelized in ghee makes<br> for the signature Birista onions that are a must in the marinade<br> as well as for topping. With a rich golden color, they add a sweet, caramelized flavor to<br> complement all the spices. Although these onions are traditionally deep-fried<br> I also have an air fryer fried onions recipe.</li>
    <li><strong>Ghee:</strong> homemade ghee helps bring authentic taste and aromas to Biryani and<br> I highly recommend using ghee instead of oil when making Biryani.</li>
    <li><strong>Herbs:</strong>fresh mint and cilantro add a perfect combination of herbs for cool,<br> citrusy flavors and a pop of color.</li>
