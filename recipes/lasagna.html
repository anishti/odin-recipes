    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="../images/lasagna.jpg" alt="Lasagna" width="200">
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty,<br> 
        made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling.<br> 
        A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with<br>
        ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage<br>  cheese and Parmesan.
        I have found none better anywhere.<br> Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Meat: </strong>This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</li>
        <li><strong>Onion: </strong>A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomatoes: </strong>You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</li>
        <li><strong>Fresh Herbs: </strong>For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</li>
        <li><strong>sugar: </strong> A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices: </strong>This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Noodles: </strong>Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese: </strong>The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs: </strong>Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).</li>
    </ul>
